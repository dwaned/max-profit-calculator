# Automated Testing Levels and Types

This document describes the actual automated tests and static analysis present in this project, along with the tools and files used at each level.

## 1. Static Tests

**Linting (Checkstyle)**
- Java code style and quality are enforced using Checkstyle.
- Configuration: `checkstyle.xml`, `checkstyle_suppressions.xml`
- Run via Maven or IDE integration.

## 2. Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on individual components or functions in isolation.

- **Property-based Tests**: Implemented in `PropertyBasedStockTests.java` using the jqwik library. These tests generate random inputs to verify properties of the `Stock` class.
- **Example-based Tests**: Implemented in `ExampleBasedTests.java` and `CalculatorControllerTest.java` using JUnit. These tests use specific input values and check expected outputs.
- **API HTTP Status Tests**: Implemented in `CalculatorControllerHttpStatusTest.java` using MockMvc and JUnit. These tests verify correct HTTP status codes (e.g., 200, 400, 405, 415) for the `/api/calculate` endpoint.
- **Mutation Tests**: Configured via PIT (pitest) in `pom.xml`. Mutation testing checks the effectiveness of the test suite by introducing code mutations and verifying that tests fail as expected.

## 3. Integration Tests

Integration tests verify the interaction between multiple components or systems.

- **Container-Tests**: Implemented in `ContainerTests.java` using Testcontainers and RestAssured. These tests run services in Docker containers to simulate real-world environments and test API endpoints.

## 4. End-to-End (E2E) Tests

E2E tests simulate real user scenarios to validate the entire application stack, from the user interface to the backend and database.

- **UI Tests**: Implemented in `PlaywrightUITests.java` using Microsoft Playwright. These tests automate browser interactions to verify the application's UI and user flows.

Each testing level is implemented with specific tools and files in this project, providing comprehensive coverage and confidence in the software's correctness.
