Feature: Cucumber Tests for the Max Profit Calculator

Scenario: Max Profit obtained without using all savings
  Given I have 6 Euros of savings
  When Array of current stock prices are "4,1,3"
  And Array of future stock prices are "5,2,6"
  Then the best combination of indices for max profit is "1,2"
  And profit is 4 Euros

Scenario: Max Profit obtained with using all savings
  Given I have 10 Euros of savings
  When Array of current stock prices are "5,5,1"
  And Array of future stock prices are "9,9,4"
  Then the best combination of indices for max profit is "0,1"
  And profit is 8 Euros

Scenario: Max Profit obtained with using 1 index
  Given I have 10 Euros of savings
  When Array of current stock prices are "2,9,3"
  And Array of future stock prices are "5,20,7"
  Then the best combination of indices for max profit is "1"
  And profit is 11 Euros

Scenario: Max Profit with same amount of savings with multiple combinations
  Given I have 10 Euros of savings
  When Array of current stock prices are "5,5,1,9"
  And Array of future stock prices are "9,9,5,5"
  Then the best combination of indices for max profit is "1,2"
  And the best combination of indices for max profit is "0,2"
  And profit is 8 Euros

Scenario: Max Profit with multiple combinations but one with less used savings
  Given I have 10 Euros of savings
  When Array of current stock prices are "6,5"
  And Array of future stock prices are "9,8"
  Then the best combination of indices for max profit is "1"
  And profit is 3 Euros

Scenario: Savings is not enough for any stock price
  Given I have 10 Euros of savings
  When Array of current stock prices are "20,12"
  And Array of future stock prices are "4,33"
  Then there is no best combination for max profit
  And no profit is made

Scenario: Random Scenario
  Given I have 9 Euros of savings
  When Array of current stock prices are "2, 2, 2, 2, 2"
  And Array of future stock prices are "5, 14, 33, 6, 5"
  Then the best combination of indices for max profit is "1, 2, 3, 4"
  And same savings and max profit is achieved with the combination "0, 1, 2, 3"
  And profit is 50 Euros
